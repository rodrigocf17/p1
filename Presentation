What did I expect to learn? Personal Presentation

Upon moving to Barcelona to undertake the Erasmus+ programme, my main educational aim was to immerse myself in new modules, 
especially ones that covered the type of content I usually would not study at home. 
Being a Biochemistry student myself, I was pleasantly surprised when I found out I could study the Current Topics of Bioinformatics â€“ 
a course that comprised of a dynamic informatic teaching of such topics from genome sequencing to Machine Learning to Programming. 
Obviously, this was only an introductory class, yet my main expectations were based in learning and managing such compelling programs 
such as Python or RStudio, ones we continuously hear people talking about, 
especially in a point in time where the proliferation of AI tools has reached a colossal magnitude.
